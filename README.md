# Retentive-Timer-Motor-Control-
This RSLogix 500 ladder logic program uses a **retentive timer (RTO)** to monitor total motor runtime across multiple start/stop cycles. The motor will automatically shut off once 10 seconds of cumulative operation is reached, and the system can be manually reset to restart the process.
